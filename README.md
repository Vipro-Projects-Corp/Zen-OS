# Zen OS
##### ZenOS is an edited version of Raspberry Pi OS (32 bit) and is supported for most older raspberry pis (3 and below).
With Zen OS, you can make your Raspberry Pi's OS easier to use by making mac-like taskbar designs and a quick access sidebar that can be opened from dragging your mouse to the top-left edge of the screen. This OS will make this way easier for people to use their Raspberry Pi.
